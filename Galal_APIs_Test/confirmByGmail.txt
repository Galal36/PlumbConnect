first create a new user like that:
on /api/users/  (post)

{
  "name": "NewClient",
  "email": "client@example.com",
  "phone": "98788432",
  "password": "client123",
  "location_id": 1,
  "role": "client"
}
1=>It will be created and the stauts field =inactive
2=>A message will sent to client@example.com with a link like  http://your-frontend-domain.com/activate/OA/ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f
with two important things 
    - OA
    -ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f
You have to provide this in postman(as me -Galal- uses postman for testing)
on endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activate/OA/ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f/ change the port if you use 8000, and run that with the two imprtant parts I mentioned, a message:'"your email is activated" and status will change to be 'active'


=> Forgetting password:
   - no need for authentication
      steps : 1- uses api/password-reset/ 2- method POST, body just send {"email": "user-who-forgot-password@example.com"}
      3-the link will be sent inbox,useapi/password-reset/confirm/ to paste the extracted uid and token(last two parts of the link sent) and newpassword,  if you need to run on postman like that:
 {
  "uidb64": "OA",
  "token": "ctz-abc123...",
  "new_password": "my-new-secure-password"
}

If done, a message {
    "message": "Password has been reset successfully."
}
