first create a new user like that:
on /api/users/  (post)

{
  "name": "NewClient",
  "email": "client@example.com",
  "phone": "98788432",
  "password": "client123",
  "location_id": 1,
  "role": "client"
}
1=>It will be created and the stauts field =inactive
2=>A message will sent to client@example.com with a link like  http://your-frontend-domain.com/activate/OA/ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f
with two important things 
    - OA
    -ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f
You have to provide this in postman(as me -Galal- uses postman for testing)
on endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activate/OA/ctz07b-9812a9d7c036cb46dee119d251da375f/ change the port if you use 8000, and run that with the two imprtant parts I mentioned, a message:'"your email is activated" and status will change to be 'active'
