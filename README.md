**PlumbConnect** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to serve the Kuwaiti market by connecting clients with professional plumbers. Built with a powerful **Django** backend and a dynamic **React** frontend, the platform provides a seamless experience for finding, communicating with, and hiring plumbing experts. Beyond a simple service marketplace, it fosters a community through a social feed and an AI-moderated knowledge base.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üë• Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiated experiences for **Clients**, **Plumbers**, and **Admins**, each with a unique dashboard and permissions.
-   **üõ†Ô∏è Service Marketplace**: Clients can browse verified plumbers, view detailed profiles with reviews and past work, and initiate service requests.
-   **üí¨ Real-Time Chat**: A WebSocket-powered chat system using Django Channels allows for instant, direct communication between clients and plumbers.
-   **‚úçÔ∏è Community Forum**: A social feed where users can create posts (with images ), comment, and reply, fostering community engagement and knowledge sharing.
-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Moderation**: Plumbers can publish technical articles. Each article is automatically reviewed by the **Google Gemini API** for technical accuracy, safety, and relevance before an admin approves it for publication.
-   **üîê Secure Authentication**: Robust JWT-based authentication (via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`) with email verification for new accounts and a secure password reset flow.
-   **üìÑ Comprehensive Profiles**: Detailed profiles for plumbers, showcasing their experience, reviews, services, and published articles.
-   **üõ°Ô∏è Reporting System**: Users can report inappropriate content (posts, comments, replies) for admin moderation, ensuring a safe and professional environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application follows a decoupled, client-server architecture.

### Backend (Django)

The backend is a monolithic Django project that exposes a RESTful API.

-   **Core Framework**: Django & Django REST Framework (DRF).
-   **Authentication**: `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for token-based auth.
-   **Real-time**: `django-channels` for WebSocket-based chat and notifications.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL for robust, relational data storage.
-   **AI Integration**: The `articles` app integrates with the Google Gemini API to automatically review content submitted by plumbers.
-   **Key Apps**:
    -   `users`: Manages user accounts, roles, profiles, and authentication.
    -   `posts`: Handles community posts, comments, replies, and likes.
    -   `articles`: Manages plumber-written articles and the AI review workflow.
    -   `services`: Manages service requests, reviews, and plumber ratings.
    -   `chats` & `chat_messages`: Powers the real-time messaging system.
    -   `reports`: Manages user-submitted reports on content.

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript.

-   **Core Framework**: React 18 & Vite.
-   **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
-   **State Management**: React Context API is used extensively (`AuthContext`, `NotificationContext`, `ApiContext`) to manage global state in a clean, modular way.
-   **UI**: `shadcn/ui` and `Tailwind CSS` for a modern, responsive, and accessible component library.
-   **Routing**: `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
-   **API Communication**: `fetch` API wrapped in dedicated service classes (`realApi.ts`, `servicesApi.ts`) to interact with the Django backend.

### Real-Time Chat Endpoints (WebSocket)

-   **Connection URL**: `ws://localhost:8001/ws/chat/{chat_id}/`
-   **Functionality**: Establishes a persistent WebSocket connection for real-time, bidirectional messaging within a specific chat room.

## Frontend Overview

The frontend is architected for scalability and maintainability, with a clear separation of concerns.

-   **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`, etc.), many of which are built upon `shadcn/ui`.
-   **`contexts/`**: Holds React Context providers for managing global state:
    -   `AuthContext.tsx`: Manages user authentication state, user data, and roles.
    -   `NotificationContext.tsx`: Handles a mock real-time notification system.
    -   `ApiContext.tsx`: A foundational context for managing API state (can be expanded).
-   **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks for abstracting complex logic:
    -   `useAuth.ts`: Core logic for authentication state.
    -   `useApi.ts`: Generic hooks for fetching data from the API (`useApiCall`, `usePost`, etc.).
    -   `useWebSocket.ts`: Manages the WebSocket connection for the chat.
-   **`services/`**: Contains API service classes that abstract `fetch` calls to the backend. This is where all direct communication with the Django API is defined.
    -   `realApi.ts`: Handles core API requests, including authentication and token refresh logic.
    -   `postsApi.ts`, `servicesApi.ts`, etc.: Modular services for different parts of the application.
-   **`pages/` (`pa/`)**: Top-level components that correspond to different routes in the application (e.g., `Home`, `Login`, `Profile`).
-   **`utils/`**: Utility functions for formatting, validation, and other common tasks.
